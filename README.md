DevOps personal development projects and plans
My primary goal is to learn the underlying skills and tools necessary to be successful in a DevOps role.
This represents a career shift for me into an area of IT that I am both excited and passionate about.
However, passion alone will not ensure success. My primary knowledge is on the Ops side, so I need exposure and development in Dev.
This will involve:

	- Learning to use tools which are specific and non-specific to my current company
		-- Bitbucket
		-- Git
		-- Jenkins
		-- Docker
		-- Chef
		-- Terraform
	- Strengthening my programing skills (I am a beginner) and learning languages specific to the tools I will be using
		-- Groovy
		-- Gradle
		-- Ruby
		-- PowerShell
As I explore these initial areas, I expect that I will discover additional skills and knowledge I had not foreseen, and I will need to remain adaptable and open to experimentation (which sounds awesome).
